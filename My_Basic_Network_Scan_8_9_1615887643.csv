This can\n    occur either when the scan occurs before one of the\n    certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one of the\n    certificate's 'notAfter' dates.\n\n  - Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature\n    that either didn't match the certificate's information\n    or could not be verified. Bad signatures can be fixed by\n    getting the certificate with the bad signature to be\n    re-signed by its issuer.
